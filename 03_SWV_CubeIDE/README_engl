I'm using a 32F469IDISCOVERY board (Cortex-M4). The integrated ST-Link V2-1 has firmware V2J37M27 and is configured as "Debug + Mass storage + VCP Modus" (default).

It doesn't look like it has a jumper or solder bridge to connect SWO and I think it's permanently connected to ST-Link.

I create an new empty project in STM32CubeIDE v1.6.1
File -> New -> STM32 Project
  Board Selector -> STM32F469I-DISCO -> Next
  Project Name: swv_foo1, Language: C, Binary Type: Executable, Project Type STM32Cube -> Next
  Firmware Package STM32Cube FW_F4 V1.26.1 -> Finish
  
  Initialize all peripherals with their default Mode? -> No
  Clock Tree shows SYSCLK is HSI -> 16MHz

  change PB3 to SYS_JTDO-SWO
  change SYS Debug: "Trace Asynchronous Sw"

  Save .ioc -> Generate Code -> YES

  Add busy loop to main.c
  void Delay (__IO uint32_t nCount)
  {
    while (nCount--)
      {
      }
  }

  and call it in the endless loop, toggle orange LED:

  while (1)
  {
    /* USER CODE END WHILE */
    HAL_GPIO_TogglePin (LED2_GPIO_Port, LED2_Pin);
    ITM_SendChar ('x');
    Delay (1000000L);
    /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
  }
  
  Project -> Build Project (finished without errors or warning)
  Run -> Debug Configurations -> STM32 Corex-M C/C++ Application -> New launch configuration
    Debugger -> ST-LINK (ST-LINK GDB server)
    Serial Wire Viewer (SWV)
      [x] Enable
      Core Clock 16MHz
      SWO Clock: 2000 kHz
      Port number: 61235
      [x] Wait for sync packet
    
    Apply -> Debug
    Download and Verifying, Debugger stopps in main at HAL_Init ()
    
  Tab "SWV ITM Data Console"
    Configure Trace:
      Timestamps
        [x] Enable Prescaler 1
      ITM Stimulus Ports
        [x] 0
      -> Ok
    Port 0 shows up
    -> red filled "record" circle (Start Trace)
  F8 (Resume)
  Orange LED (LED2) starts to blink but
  SWV Trace Log, SWV ITM Data Console, SWV Statistical Profiling  keeps empty.

  I've checked DGBMCU_CR and it's 0xe0042004 so
  TRACE_IOEN = 1
  TRACE_MODE = 00: TRACE pin assignment for Asynchronous Mode
  
  chapter 37.14.2 of the STM32F469xx reference manual says
  0xC5ACCE55 has to be written @E0000FB0 but I'm unsure if this shouldn't be done from the debugger.

  dm00354244-stm32-microcontroller-debug-toolbox-stmicroelectronics.pdf
  doesn't even mention it but I also tried

    volatile uint32_t *ITM_LAR = (volatile uint32_t *)0xE0000FB0; // ITM->LAR
    *ITM_LAR = 0xC5ACCE55; // Enable Access
    
  but this doesn't change anything.

  I'm really running out of ideas here. Can someone help me?
